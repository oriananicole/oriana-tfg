* where to pass the currentTime argument
  - in evalAll* or in allFitness?
  - should be same place as spPopSizes, so both in the same functions, for coherence


* Verify mutator and FDF
  - Tests not unlike those in
    - test.mutator.R
    - test.Z-mutator.R
    - test.flfast-mutator.R
    - test.mutator-oncoSimulSample.R

* vi√±etas
  - interventions

* tests of FDF and time
  - without FDF time no effect: add tests for this
  - with FDF in fitness not dependent on time: no changes

* mutator: use exprTk?
  - change mutation rate as a function of:
    - time
    - genotype frequencies or population size
    - Do the above make sense or are really needed?
  - change mutation rate genome-wide or per locus?

* time and FDF: a way to model adaptive oncogenesis
  - add to vignette
