(This does not apply now, as we had to remove randutils.hpp until we can
use gcc >= 4.8 in Windows to compile R packages.)

All code, except src/randutils.h, is copyright Ramon Diaz-Uriarte and
licensed under the GPL (>=3).


The code in src/randutils.h is copyright Melissa E. O'Neill, and is
licensed under "The MIT License (MIT)" in the terms explained in the file
itself. This license is compatible with the GPL (see
http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:Expat). The file randutils.hpp was
downloaded from https://gist.github.com/imneme/540829265469e673d045 on
2015-06-20 and is also referenced from the main article
http://www.pcg-random.org/posts/ease-of-use-without-loss-of-power.html.  I
(RDU) have renamed it to randutils.h (to comply with R) and have changed
the line

auto exit_func = hash(&_Exit);

by

auto getenv_func = hash(&getenv);

to keep R from complaining about using the Exit function (it is not using
it, just getting its address).
