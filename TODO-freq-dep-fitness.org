* Miscell to-do in freq-dep-fitness branch

** first
   
  - [X] binary files were changed: explain:
    - [X] OncoSimulR/data/examplesFitnessEffects.RData
    - [X] OncoSimulR/inst/testdata_fee.RData
    - [X] miscell-files/fee.RData

  - [X] test_mutator.R:
    - line 208: is it "genotype" or "Genotype"

  - [X] is stringr really needed? Leave it for now.
  - [X] is combn needed? (see NAMESPACE). Leave it, as it is from utils.


  - [X] update to latest version of exprTk: 
    - http://www.partow.net/programming/exprtk/index.html
    - https://github.com/ArashPartow/exprtk
 
  - [X] why can't mutator effects be used?
    - this is said in the vignette (I think) and in oncoSimulIndiv.Rd

  - [X] clarify in both vignette and help that non-specified genotypes
    have fitness 0
    - a simple example in freq-depn-non-specified.R 


  - [ ] stopping conditions: allow with detectionDrivers?
    - [ ] in general, verify stopping: but then, no reason it shouldn't as
      that has not been touched.
      - Some code in fdf-stopping.
      - [ ] add to formal tests.
    - [ ] stop based on "stable results"?
  - [ ] all compilation warnings: fix.

  - [ ] explain in vignette why this was possible without touching OncoSimulR_init.c, RcppExports.cpp

  - [ ] double check from_genot_utils.R (why?)

  - [X] check under Windows: failing in appveyor. NO LONGER A PROBLEM
    - C:/Rtools/mingw_32/bin/../lib/gcc/i686-w64-mingw32/4.9.3/../../../../i686-w64-mingw32/bin/as.exe: new_restrict.o: too many sections

      - Not possible to force -O3?

      - https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/too-many-sections/6261   [R specific?]
      - ExprTk: this has been reported: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31890021/mingw-too-many-sections-bug-while-compiling-huge-header-file-in-qt

	- https://github.com/MrKepzie/Natron/blob/master/Engine/ExprTk.cpp
          [see lines
	  - // exprtk requires -Wa,-mbig-obj on mingw, but there is a bug that prevents linking if not using -O3
          - // see:

          ]
      - affects other libraries too (see above last two links)
  - [ ] check size of package with included exprTk
  - [ ] compilation warnings for comparisons between ints, etc.
  - [ ] why is the library under inst/miscell? Well, now under src.
    - Also: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51571906/which-is-the-best-way-to-develop-an-r-package-that-needs-a-heavy-c-library
    - yes, definitely, down the road, leave under /inst/include: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36927141/syncing-rcpp-with-external-headers-and-libraries-to-build-a-batch-geocoding-pack

  - Not unlike this reported issue:
    - https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2017-March/073846.html

       [same thing, easier to read]

*** mingw issue: using Rtools35.exe. NOT AN ISSUE ANTMORE
    - The file to use in Windoze is, for system-wide packages,
      C:/Users/ramon/.R/Makevars.win [nope, do not go to users/whatever/Documents]
    - The variable is: CXX11FLAGS [using only CXXFLAGS was not overwriding
      the -O2]
    - Still, with only -O3 or with both -Wa,-mbig-obj -O3 I still get the
      same problems of too many sections
    - I try with "--no-multiarch" (R CMD INSTALL --no-multiarch) so it only tries to build the 64-bit version:
      - Only with "-O3": fails with "too many section (52845)"
      - Only with "-Wa,-mbig-obj":
      - With both "-Wa,-mbig-obj -O3 -":
	- takes more than 40 when building the dll. (empieza a las 13:25): uses
          1 core at 99%, and uses about 140 MB RAM. Killed after 40
          minutes.
	- all of this has happened before fopr other packages (see above)
	       - http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/Seeking-advice-regarding-compilation-of-large-libraries-using-RTools-Windows-td4729418.html

*** Rtools40: SOLVED
    - Several dependencies of OncoSimulR fail: igraph, new, lme4 ,
      pbkrtest (for car), etc.
    - I give up after install one of the dependencies of igraph.
    - After all, this is still using gcc from mingw32

*** LLVM/clang? IS THIS RELEVANT NOW?
    - It should work, but I do not see how to use clang in windowze.
    - The report from ExpTrk's autho indictes he can get ExprTk to work
      under Windowze with clang.
      - Using clang with R: these three would seem to suggest one can use clag:
	- http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/src.html
	- https://r-pkgs.org/
	- https://teuder.github.io/rcpp4everyone_en/020_install.html
	- But then, this says clang cannot be used:
	  - https://groups.google.com/d/msg/stan-users/QeQaEqFqyow/5wksPBacBQAJ
	- And I cerntainly do not seem to be able to make it work with Rtools.
	- Of course it cannot work with clang in windoze: see, e.g.,
          question 2.9 and 1.3 in the Rcpp-FAQ.pdf: the toolchain just
          does not suppor it: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-FAQ.pdf
	  - and this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/10723987
	  - and this:
            https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp/issues/728#issuecomment-313019053
            [yes, it is MSVC, but says gcc only]
      

**** virtualbox notes
     - the screen size, etc: do "view full screeen mode" and then "auto
       resize". Seems to work (?)

** second
  - [X] change frequencyType = unemployed by NULL.
  - [X] can we mix freq. with absolute? Yes, because any frequency
    can be expressed as a ratio of numbers.
  - [X] death rate: cannot become smaller than initial. That would be the
    default, basely one. Otherwise, it is not possible to get a collapse
    here, because death rate always adjusted.
    - In bnb_common.cpp, updateRatesFDFMcFarlandLog
    - fixed: McFLD as another model
  - [ ] isn't frequencyType redundant? Couldn't we guess if from "f" or
    "n"? So no need for "frequencyType = 'rel'"



** to fix. 
  - [X] is allMutator Effects working? Nope. It doesn't

** miscell
   - Add 
   R_forceSymbols(dll, TRUE);

   in void R_init_OncoSimulR(DllInfo *info) {

   in OncoSimulR_init.c
